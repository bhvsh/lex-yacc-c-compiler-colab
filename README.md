# LEX and YACC C Compiler in Colab 

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bhvsh/lex-yacc-c-compiler-colab/blob/main/LEX_and_YACC_Compiler.ipynb)

This repository contains the code for a C compiler implemented using the LEX and YACC tools, and run in the Google Colaboratory environment. The compiler is able to parse and compile C code, producing an executable file as output. The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up the Colaboratory environment and running the compiler. This project is intended for educational purposes and as a demonstration of how LEX and YACC can be used to build a compiler.
